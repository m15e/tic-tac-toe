## Command Line Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to Command Line Tic Tac Toe.
Tic Tac Toe is a two player game, in which players take turns placing their marker, either an X or an O, on a 3 by 3 grid.
The player that successfully places three of their markers in a horizontal, diagonal or vertical row wins.
If the board is full and no player has succeeded completing a row of three, it's a draw.
